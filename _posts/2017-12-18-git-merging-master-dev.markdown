## Background

Just a simple note-to-self so I don't forget. 

## Approach

1. Merge the master branch with development branch to resolve any merge conflicts
    - i.e. master --> dev
    - This will help in keeping the master branch clean.

2. Fix merge conflicts (if there are any).

3. Merge development branch with the master branch.
    - i.e. dev --> master
